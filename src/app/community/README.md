# Community

Optional community board built into Command GCS. Provides changelog, a kanban board, roadmap, and a contact form.

All community data lives on the Altnautica Convex backend. The hosted version at [command.altnautica.com/community](https://command.altnautica.com/community) runs it by default. Local builds have it disabled unless you configure your own backend.

## Enabling it

1. Set up a [Convex](https://convex.dev) project and deploy the functions from `website/convex/`
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` in your `.env.local` to your Convex deployment URL
3. Restart the dev server

Without `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`, the community section shows a fallback message. Everything else in the GCS works normally.

## Routes

| Route | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/community/changelog` | Version history and release notes |
| `/community/kanban` | Admin-only board for triaging items |
| `/community/roadmap` | Public roadmap view |
| `/community/contact` | Contact form (no auth required) |

## Auth

- **Viewing** changelog, roadmap: public, no auth needed
- **Contact form**: public, no auth needed
- **Kanban board**: admin only
- **Comments**: requires auth

## Not required for drone operations

The community feature is completely separate from flight control, telemetry, mission planning, and FC configuration. Removing or disabling it has zero effect on drone functionality.
