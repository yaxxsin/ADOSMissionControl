/**
 * @module hooks/use-auth-keystore-sync
 * @description Purges MAVLink signing keys from IndexedDB on every auth
 * state change so a shared machine cannot leak user A's keys to user B.
 *
 * Call once at the app root (layout or ConvexClientProvider).
 *
 * Behavior by transition:
 *   - Anonymous -> Signed in as user U:
 *       purgeForUser(U). Records tagged with a different userId are
 *       deleted. Anonymous records (userId === null) are preserved.
 *   - Signed in as U -> Signed out:
 *       purgeForUser(null). Records tagged with any userId are deleted.
 *       Anonymous records are preserved.
 *   - Signed in as U -> Signed in as V (same browser):
 *       purgeForUser(V). User U's records get deleted.
 *
 * Fixes audit finding B3 (user-switch keystore leak on shared devices).
